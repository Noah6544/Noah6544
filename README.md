### Just a high schooler from metro Atlanta wanting to major in CS and do big things.
#### I’m currently working on:
1. (Passion Project): A daily picture aligner automation tool, which would take a large directory of images and align the image to eye coordinates. This is in hopes to automate the many hours of editing and dedication needed to a long project.

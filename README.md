### Just a high schooler from metro Atlanta wanting to major in CS and do big things.
#### I’m currently working on:
- (Passion Project): A daily picture aligner automation tool, which would take a large directory of images and align the image to eye coordinates. This is in hopes to automate the many hours of editing and dedication needed to a long project.

#### Projects I've contributed to:
- Project "Inspire Technology":
<br /> - I finished teaching a class of 4-5th graders over the span of 5 weeks how to code in python! The data I gathered from before/after survers were very positive and I see that a few students went above and beyond and took their learning outside of our class. I'm planning on building a educational website targeted for this age group.

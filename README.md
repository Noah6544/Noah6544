### Just a high schooler from metro Atlanta wanting to major in CS and do big things.
#### I’m currently working on:
1. My research project for my school's science fair. I'm investigating the effects of facial recognition on racial bias. First large scale python project spanning many files and directories, and using different tools for data analysis on thousands of numbers.
2. (Passion Project): A daily picture aligner automation tool, which would take a large directory of images and align the image to eye coordinates. This is in hopes to automate the many hours of editing and dedication needed to a long project.
